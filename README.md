# Mumtaz Aziz's Music
Yap, I made it open-source!

Sources and assets of my music will be available here on this repo. This includes, but is not limited to:
-   Project bundles (FL Studio, Live, or Logic Pro)
-   Album artworks
-   Sheet music (MuseScore)
-   Synchronized lyrics (LRC or WebVTT)

There's nothing to see now, so please look forward to my upcoming releases.
